       <h1> ~ In the Ancient time ~ </h1>
   <h2>   In the ancient time people travelled to India from various parts of the world like India was  a pot full of gold as India was a very rich source of things like spices, silk, textiles, precious stones like gold in fact the romans came to India just for a spice  and that is pepper, they even called "black gold"! pepper is often found in south India so they often visited south India and traded pepper with gold!. Merchants and traders travelled to India to acquire these goods and establish trade relations. pilgrims from China, southeast Asia, and the middle east traveled to India to visit scared sites, study religious texts,  and seek spiritual enlightenment. education and knowledge. People travel for many reasons, to learn about unfamiliar places and cultures, to visit friends and families and for professional purpose. </h2>
